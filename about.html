		There is a broadly agreed hierarchy between the instrument groupings and within each group of instruments. There is a principal in every of 
		our APU instrumental group or section, who is typically in charge of directing the ensemble and performing orchestral solos. First and 
		second violins are two separate sets of violins, with second violins playing in lower registers than first violins, performing a supporting part or harmonising the first violins' melody. The 
		leading first violin is referred to as the concertmaster, which is right behind the conductor. The concertmaster directs the orchestra's pre-concert 
		tuning and manages the orchestra's musical operations, including decision-making. Ordinarily, the concertmaster sits on the left hand side of conductor, who is the closest to the spectators. Other principal instruments include a principal viola, a principal cello, a principal bass, and a principal second violin.

		While the trumpet of principal is typically known as the whole brass section's leader, the principal trombone is the leader of the low brass section. Despite a 300-year-old custom, 
		the oboe frequently serves as the orchestra's tuning note, the woodwind section doesn't typically have a designated principal. Instead, when there are musical disagreements, each principle consults with the others on an equal footing. In addition, nearly all sections have an assistant principal, 
		or applied to the case of the first violins, which known as an assistant concertmaster, who frequently performs a tutti part in addition to taking the principal's place when he or she is absent.
		<br/><br/>
		<br/><br/>
		With the exception of divided or divisi parts, when the upper and lower parts of the music are frequently allocated to "outside", 
		which is nearer the audience and "inside" seated players, a section string player plays in sync with the rest of the section. In a string section, the section leader will almost always play the solo part when it is required. The bowings of a string section are 
		also selected by its leader, often in accordance with the concertmaster's specified bowings. To meet the demands of playing their instrument, the principal of a string section may occasionally adopt a slightly different bowing than the concertmaster. 
		In order to make sure the section performs together, the string section's principals will also guide their group to enter the performance's place, generally by elevating their bow before entering. In a tutti, each wind and brass performer has a distinctive but non-solo role. 
		The chief percussionist assigns the section percussionists specific roles to play. 		
		<br/><br/>
		<br/><br/>
		The concertmaster or also known as harpsichordist served as the orchestra's conductor in early orchestras by playing the continuo, which contrasts with the conductors of today. Since some modern orchestras 
		does not have conductors, notably smaller orchestras and those specialised in historically is 
		accurate, which so-called "period" performances of ostentatious and earlier music. Western classical music or opera is the symphony orchestra's most often performed repertoire. However, orchestras are frequently utilised in cinema music, occasionally in popular music, 
		for example, to collaborate with a rock or pop band in a concert, and more frequently in video game soundtrack. The symphonic metal subgenre also makes use of orchestras. A jazz ensemble may alternatively be referred to as a "orchestra," as in the case of big-band performances.
